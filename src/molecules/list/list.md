# List

Composition-based list primitives under the `frappe-ui/list` subpath. Every list
surface is one column grid: a feed row is just the default column template, a
table is an explicit one. The family owns geometry — columns, dividers, hover
surfaces, selection and sort chrome — and nothing readable: cell contents
(typography, avatars, badges, unread emphasis) are entirely app-authored.

Not to be confused with the config-driven `ListView` in the main entry — that
stays untouched; import from `frappe-ui/list` for this family.

## Feed mode

The default template (`auto`, `minmax(0,1fr)`, `auto`) fits leading media,
content, and a right-aligned trailing cell. Rows with `to` render as
RouterLinks, rows with a click listener as buttons. `selectable` reveals the
animated checkbox column and switches row click from navigate to toggle;
selected values surface through `v-model:selection`. When a `ListHeader` is
present, a select-all checkbox appears in it automatically — checked when every
row is selected, mixed when only some are, and toggling all rows on or off. It
reasons over the full `ListRows` items, so it covers virtualized rows too.
`ListRows` resolves each row's identity once and exposes it as the scoped
`value` prop. The identity defaults to the item's `name`/`id`; pass `row-key` (a
field name or `(item, index) => key`) when the row should use a different field.

Dividers default to `inset`: they start at the content column (the text edge) by
construction, never render above the first row, and hide around a hovered row so
the rounded hover surface floats free.

## Active row

A master–detail list (a mail inbox, a file browser) tracks one open row. Bind
`v-model:active` to a row `value` and the List owns the rest: it highlights that
row and hides the dividers hugging it — above and below — so its rounded surface
floats free, like a hovered row but persistent. Clicking a row sets `active`;
unlike `selectable`, activation is additive, so the row's own `@click` and `to`
navigation still run. It's single-select and independent of the multi-select
checkbox `selection` — and works in feed or column mode.

```vue
<List v-model:active="openId">
  <ListRows :items="threads" v-slot="{ value }">
    <ListRow :value="value">…</ListRow>
  </ListRows>
</List>
```

## Column mode

Pass explicit `columns` (deterministic track sizes — `auto` tracks size
independently per row) and a `ListHeader`. Header and rows share one
`--list-columns` template, so they can never drift.

`ListHeaderCell` is a plain label with optional `#prefix` / `#suffix`
adornments. Sortable columns use `ListHeaderCellSort` instead — a controlled
sort button: you hand it the active `direction` (`asc` / `desc` / `null`) and
update your own sort state in its `click` handler. Your code owns the state,
toggle rules, direction glyphs (via the scoped `#suffix="{ direction }"` slot),
and whether ordering happens client-side or through `useList` orderBy. The cell
keeps only the behavioral chrome: a real button, `aria-sort`, the tooltip, and
revealing an inactive column's suffix on hover. Both variants render the same
`data-slot="list-header-cell"` geometry, so mixing them in one header is
seamless.

## Virtual rows

`ListRows` iterates items through its scoped slot; with `virtual`, only rows
near the viewport mount. The scoped slot receives `{ item, index, value }`,
where `value` is the string row identity used by select-all and active-row
state. The scroll container is the nearest scrollable ancestor — the list
windows against an app-owned scroll area (a settings body, the page) and keeps
its scrollbar. `itemHeight` defaults to the List's `rowHeight`. The underlying
composable, `useVirtualRows`, is exported for exotic cases.

## Styling hooks

`--list-columns` and `--list-gap` (default `0.5rem`) are public hooks on the
List — override them with plain classes, responsively if needed. People-style
lists collapse to a feed on mobile with no dedicated API:

```vue
<List
  :columns="['minmax(8rem,1fr)', '5.5rem', '5.5rem']"
  class="max-sm:[--list-columns:auto_minmax(0,1fr)_auto]"
>
```

with `max-sm:hidden` on the numeric cells and the `ListHeader`.

For `--list-gap` and `--list-row-padding-x` (the content inset shared by
interactive rows — default `0.75rem` — and the column header, so setting it on
the `List` aligns both), the frappe-ui Tailwind preset ships spacing-scale
utilities — `list-gap-*` and `list-row-px-*` — so the usual authoring form is
`max-sm:list-gap-3 sm:list-gap-4` rather than raw `[--list-gap:0.75rem]`
properties. Both forms hit the same CSS vars.

Cells (and plain header cells) are flex containers with `items-center` — align
content with justify utilities (`class="justify-end"` for numeric columns),
responsively if needed. For sortable numeric headers, use
`<ListHeaderCellSort align="end">` so the sort glyph moves to the leading side
and the label stays flush with the column edge.

Slots for CSS targeting:
`data-slot="list | list-header | list-header-cell | list-row | list-cell | list-row-checkbox | list-divider"`.
State: `data-state="selected"` (checkbox selection), `data-active` (+
`aria-current`, the `v-model:active` row) and `data-interactive` on rows,
`data-sort` on the active header cell.

Accessibility follows header presence: `role="list"` / `"listitem"` without a
`ListHeader`, `table` / `row` / `columnheader` / `cell` (plus `aria-sort`) with
one.
